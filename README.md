## :bell: About
A Shopping Cart App imitating real Game Store website. Game data comes from RAWG API.   
[Live Demo](https://quartezz.github.io/Shopping-Cart/) 

## :wrench: Technologies Used
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- React Router
- Axios
- npm
- webpack
- eslint
- babel  

## :book: What I learned
The most important thing I managed to learn is how to use fetch to collect data and use it thanks to the API. The other new thing I learned is how to set up React Router to navigate between pages faster.
  

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
